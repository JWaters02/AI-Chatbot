Task 1: 
ANN Test accuracy: 0.881

Task 2:
Lab's CNN model's test accuracy: 0.896
My CNN model's test accuracy: 0.918

My model's changes:
- Added 3rd convolutional layer (same parameters as other two)
- Adjusted neuron dropout rate to 0.3
- Changed activation function to softmax due to the program being for multi-class classification
