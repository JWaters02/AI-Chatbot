In task 1 (SLD), can the heuristic function be admissible? Why?

A heuristic is admissable if it does not overestimate the cost of reaching the goal. Straight line distance, including movement along a diagonal, is admissable because it always under estimates or is equal to the actual distance. 

What about in task 2 (Manhattan distance)? Why?

Yes, it is admissable because the Manhattan distance always under estimates the actual distance.

What about task 3 (Manhattan distance + no diagonal move)? Why?

Yes, it is admissable because the Manhattan distance + no diagonal move always under estimates the actual distance.
